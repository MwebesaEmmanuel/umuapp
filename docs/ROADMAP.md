# Roadmap (high level)

## Phase 1 — MVP foundation

- Flutter app shell (tabs + login + visitor mode)
- Backend auth + roles + core modules (already started)
- Campus map (Google Maps) + office directory
- Announcements/events + push notifications

## Phase 2 — Student + staff workflows

- Digital ID (QR) + attendance scanning UI
- Course evaluation + portal links (WebView + deep links)
- Helpdesk + ICT ticketing workflows + status tracking

## Phase 3 — Transport, library, and systems integration

- Bus tracking + booking (requires GPS devices or driver app)
- Library integration (catalog + account if APIs exist)
- Connect to university systems via APIs/SSO (preferred) instead of scraping

## Phase 4 — AI assistant (UMU knowledge)

- UMU knowledge base ingestion (policies, FAQs, handbooks)
- RAG pipeline + guardrails + admin content updates
